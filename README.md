>Using Multi Layer Perceptron an Intrusion Detection System is Developed which assesses the network behavior and provides security from different types of cyber attacks.
>Used Random Forest Algorithm for Feature Selection & MLP for Classification.
>The model classifies can detect suspicious network behavior on the basis of Network Characteristics 
>The model can classify different kinds of attacks and can alert the system about any attack behavior.
